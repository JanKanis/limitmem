If the last process in the scope is killed by the oom killer, the scope does not exit but remains in a 'failed' status. Its associated cgroup is deleted however, so it doesn't present an issue for us. The scope can be deleted manually using the `systemd --user reset-failed` command, or it can be set to do so automatically by setting the CollectMode=inactive-or-failed property on the unit. This can not be edited when the unit has already started using `systemctl set-property`, but it can be changed by setting it in /run/user/<UID>/systemd/transient/snap.node.node-*.scope.d/override.conf and then running `systemctl --user daemon-reload`.
